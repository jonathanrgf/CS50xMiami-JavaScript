# Week 2 Assignment
Complete variables.js and commit your work to Github.


## 0. The Fortune Teller part 2
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
Write a function named tellFortune that:
- takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
- outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.


## 1. The Age Calculator part 2
Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!
Write a function named calculateAge that:
- takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
- calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
- outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
- Call the function three times with different sets of values.
- Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.


## 2. The Lifetime Supply Calculator part 2
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply that:
- takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
- calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
- outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
- Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
- Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.


## 3. The Geometrizer part 2
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here:
http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm
Create a function called calcCircumfrence:
- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:
- Pass the radius to the function.
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".


## 4. The Temperature Converter part 2
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html
Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
